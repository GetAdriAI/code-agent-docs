See the complete prompt in the attached document.\\n\\nMy first impressions:\\n\\n1. Table selection: Both models hallucinated incorrect tables on their first attempt. Opus 4.5 self-corrected after one prompt; Sonnet 4.5 needed two.\\n\\n2. Syntax errors: Both models produced syntax errors initially. Opus 4.5 fixed them after one prompt; Sonnet 4.5 took five attempts.\\n\\n3. Scope discipline: Opus 4.5 produced only what was requested. Sonnet 4.5 added unrequested features and documentation, increasing output length and review time.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\n-> Opus 4.5 reached an error-free solution in 3 iterations; Sonnet 4.5 took 7.\\n-> Opus 4.5\'s leaner output made its first attempt ~50% faster to generate.\\n\\nThis was a simple, quick test. I\'m planning to try more complex scenarios next.

You learn about:\\n\\n- BAdI implementations like ZSD_CREDIT_CHECK,\\n- Tables (VBAK, KNKK) you need to regression test,\\n- CDS views with related logic,\\n- Even past transports you might have forgotten.\\n\\nNow you can decide:\\n\\n- which enhancements to review,\\n- what downstream integrations (credit exposure reports, for example) could break, and\\n- exactly what to drop into your change spec or automated checks.\\n\\nResult: Less time wasted digging through SE11/SE84, fewer missed dependencies, and a clearer rollout plan for every change request.\\n\\nWe\u2019re putting the final polish on the release right now."}]}}')}}]);
