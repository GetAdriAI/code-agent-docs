# SAP Research Agent Private beta launch

Yesterday, we opened up free access to our SAP Change Request agent for everyone who requested it earlier.

The response has been amazing! So we're expanding access limits and squashing a few bugs we found along the way.

Trust me, it's pretty cool watching the agent work through your problems step by step.

Here's what makes this different from ChatGPT: it doesn't just give you generic answers. It checks solutions against your actual system configuration. For this free version, we're validating against all 18 million standard objects in ECC 6.0 EHP 7.

A few ways you can put it to work:

1. Find standard SAP capabilities before you write custom code
2. Generate functional and technical specs
3. Find the right SAP objects for what you need
