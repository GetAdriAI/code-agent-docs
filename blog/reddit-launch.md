# SAP Research Agent Reddit Launch

We launched on Reddit and it crashed our app. 🫠

I had assumed Reddit wasn't where our audience was. So I posted at midnight and went to sleep.

My expectations were low. I had assumed that:

- Reddit isn't the place for enterprise AI
- The post wouldn't get visibility since AI is a contentious topic in SAP subreddits

What actually happened was that we received so much traffic that our app was down for 3 hours. 😅

What I learned:

1️⃣ Make it ridiculously easy to try your software

I didn't lead with fancy efficiency numbers. Just "here's what the tool does" with a link to try it for free, no login required.

There's so much noise in the AI market right now. Even if you're an early entrant in your category, there's a good chance people have been burned by an AI promise before.

If you add any friction, (say a signup button), they'll decide you probably won't work for them, and will readily move on with their day.

The only thing that cuts through is letting them experience it themselves.

2️⃣ Do staggered launches.
Don't blow everything on one big moment. Spread it out.

3️⃣ Launch everywhere.
It's typical startup advice, but harder to actually practice than it sounds.

Now, on to celebrating that we're the #1 post on r/ABAP today 🎉
