# Welcome to Adri AI Docs

These docs show how to use SAP Research Agent to speed up pre-implementation research, produce accurate specs, and run smarter searches across your SAP landscape. Whether you are validating configuration, drafting change requests, or hunting down objects, you will find workflows and reference material tailored to those tasks.

## What to expect?

- **Actionable tutorials** – Jump into the [Research Agent guide](research-agent/research-intro.md) for hands-on walkthroughs (search workflows, object catalogs, ChromaSQL examples) aimed at SAP functional and technical teams.
- **Conceptual clarity** – Read the [AI Concepts](ai-concepts/semantic-search.md) section to understand how semantic search, embeddings, and agent patterns power the tooling.
- **Precise references** – Use the [Glossary](glossary/model_name.md) when you need definitions, relationships, and naming conventions for SAP objects referenced throughout this docs.

Let's get started!
